HOW THE WAREHOUSE ID NUMBER SOFTWARE WORKS

*NOTE* There is no specific ID existing for a Warehouse.
1. Once the input field detects data entery, it will notify you below "invalid warehouse number" this is because the number is incomplete
2. When the Warehouse ID number is complete, the input field will prevent further input and then notify you "checking for warehouse".
3. Click the "Check up store" button to submit the entered ID and alert will pop up notifying you that the system is checking for correspondidng Warehouse. 
however, as no specific ID exist, the system will not return any Warehouse. 

4. If you need further information or modification, kindly let me know.

Thank you.
